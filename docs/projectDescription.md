# Introduction Project 

## Radio Telemetry Tracking - Simple QGIS Application

### Introduction:
The Radio Telemetry Tracking project is a collaboration with the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research, with the overall goal of developing an efficient drone-based system of tracking animals with radio transmitters. Our ground control UI is built using the PyQt5 GUI library, and we handle our data visualizations using QGIS. This intro project will act as an introduction to this aspect the the overall project.

### Intro Project Goal:
Create a simple QGIS application in python using PyQGIS and PyQt5 libraries. The application will be designed/implemented according to OOD principles.

#### Application Requirements:
 - The application will have the ability to load in a GeoTIFF image as a basemap
 - The application will have the ability to load webmap tiles as a basemap
 - Ability to load in and display content from a shapefile
 - Ability to convert/load in and display information from geoJSON
 - Ability to parse data and display certain entries from the data set - (ex: buildings, parks, roads, population)

#### Tools/Skills Involved:
 - UI/UX Design/Implementation
 - Python 
 - PyQt5
 - PyQGIS
 - Software Documentation

#### References/tutorials:
 * QGIS Useful Docs:
     - <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/intro.html"> Using PyQGIS in a custom application </a>

#### Project Steps
* Members use application requirements to plan out the structure of the application. (Draw out wire frames, data flow, etc.)
* Members break down planned components into tasks
* The rest of the quarter is spent implementing features of the application
